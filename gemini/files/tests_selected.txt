```python
def contas(a, b):
     c = a + b
     d = c + 1
     if d >= 10:
         return d * 10
     else:
         return d

def contas(a, b):
     c = a + b
     d = c + 1
     if d < 10:
         return d * 10
     else:
         return d

def contas(a, b):
     c = a - b
     d = c - 1
     if d < 10:
         return d * 10
     else:
         return d

def contas(a, b):
    c = a - b
    d = c -1
    if d > 10:
        return d
```
These four tests cover the key aspects:  addition and subtraction,  the different conditional checks (`if d >= 10`, `if d < 10`, `if d > 10`), and the two possible return values (d and d*10) when the result needs to be greater than 5.  The modulo operator (%) is less important here because the goal is to ensure the final result is above 5, and multiplication by 10 easily achieves this.
