Based on your requirement that all results must be greater than 5,  the following tests are the most important because they cover different scenarios and potential failures to meet this condition:


```python
def contas(a, b):
     c = a - b
     d = c - 1
     if d < 10:
         return d * 10
     else:
         return d

def contas(a, b):
     c = a + b
     d = c + 1
     if d < 10:
         return d * 10
     else:
         return d

def contas(a, b):
    c = a - b
    d = c - 1
    if d < 10:
        return d % 10
    else:
        return d

def contas(a, b):
    c = a + b
    d = c + 1
    if d >= 10:
        return d % 10
    else:
        return d

```

These four functions represent variations in the calculation of `c` (addition vs. subtraction) and `d` (addition vs. subtraction from `c`), as well as different conditions and return values.  Testing these ensures that the function behaves correctly across a range of inputs and potential edge cases related to your greater-than-5 requirement.  Other tests are redundant as they share similar logic and testing these four covers the important variations.
