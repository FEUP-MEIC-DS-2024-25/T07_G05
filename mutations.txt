The phrase "maior de 5" is Portuguese for "greater than 5".  Therefore, we need tests that cover numbers greater than 5, equal to 5, and less than 5 to ensure comprehensive coverage.  We also need a test for a boundary condition or edge case to ensure robustness.

Assuming your program has a function called `is_greater_than_five(number)`, here are four tests:


```python
import unittest

class TestGreaterThanFive(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_greater_than_five(self):
        self.assertTrue(is_greater_than_five(6))

    def test_equal_to_five(self):
        self.assertFalse(is_greater_than_five(5))

    def test_less_than_five(self):
        self.assertFalse(is_greater_than_five(4))

    def test_large_number(self): #Boundary/Edge Case
        self.assertTrue(is_greater_than_five(1000))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Remember to replace `is_greater_than_five(number)` with the actual name of your function.  You'll also need to define that function to make these tests run.
